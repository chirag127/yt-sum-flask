# Security Policy

## Our Commitment

The project team for `TubeDigest-AI-Powered-YouTube-Summarizer-API-Service` is dedicated to maintaining the security and integrity of our codebase. We value the contributions of the security research community and believe that responsible disclosure is essential for safeguarding our users.

We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities in a timely and effective manner.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

To ensure the confidentiality of your findings and protect our users, please report all potential security vulnerabilities privately via GitHub's security advisory system. This is the fastest and most effective way to reach our team.

1.  Navigate to the **[Security Tab](https://github.com/chirag127/TubeDigest-AI-Powered-YouTube-Summarizer-API-Service/security)** of the repository.
2.  Click the **"Report a vulnerability"** button.
3.  Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including:
    *   A clear and concise summary of the issue.
    *   Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the vulnerability.
    *   The potential impact (e.g., data exfiltration, denial of service, remote code execution).
    *   Any suggested mitigations or fixes, if known.

We will make every effort to acknowledge your report within 48 hours and will provide regular updates on our progress.

## Supported Versions

Security updates are applied to the most recent major release. Please ensure you are using the latest version to benefit from security patches.

| Version | Supported          |
| :------ | :----------------- |
| `1.x`   | :white_check_mark: |
| `< 1.0` | :x:                |

## Security Best Practices

This project leverages several automated security measures to maintain a high standard of security:

-   **Dependabot Alerts:** Automatically scans for known vulnerabilities in our dependencies and creates pull requests for updates.
-   **CodeQL Analysis:** Integrated into our CI/CD pipeline to perform static analysis and identify potential security flaws before they are merged.
-   **Secret Scanning:** Actively scans the repository for accidentally committed secrets and credentials.

We encourage all contributors to follow secure coding practices and to be vigilant about potential security risks.
